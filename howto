Install nacl toolchain in $HOME/root/ (so that compilers are in $HOME/root/nacl-sdk/bin).

Grab nacl64/lib/libstdc++.a from toolchain r4777 and overwrite the one in the your toolchain with it.

If there is no nacl64/lib/libnosys.a in the toolchain, create an empty one.

Build and install all naclports, don't forget the patch.
NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=$HOME/root/nacl-sdk ./nacl-install-all-bitsize.sh 64

Build and install the following packages from http://github.com/eugenis.
Most of them have a build.sh script in the repository root. "A -> B" mean B depends on A.
  bzip2 -> boost
  glib -> pango
  SDL_mixer
  SDL_image
  SDL_ttf
  SDL_net

Get wesnoth-1.9.5 from official site, apply the patch (wesnoth-1.9.5-nacl.patch), run build.sh.


# Optional: Significantly reduces the amount of flood from sel_ldr.
cp /etc/localtime $HOME/root/nacl-sdk/nacl64/etc/localtime

# Optional(?): mkdir is not implemented in NaCl/GLibC at the moment
mkdir -p ./.wesnoth1.9/editor/maps  ./.wesnoth1.9/data/add-ons ./.wesnoth1.9/saves ./.wesnoth1.9/persist

# In the NaCl tree, build the loader
./scons platform=x86-64 --mode=dbg-linux sel_universal sel_ldr ncval_stubout sdl_sel_universal=1

# Stub out all invalid instructions in the wesnoth binary.
./scons-out/dbg-linux-x86-64/staging/ncval_stubout @WESNOTH_BUILD_DIR@/wesnoth-debug -o wesnoth-debug-stubout

# Run wesnoth
scons-out/dbg-linux-x86-64/staging/sel_universal -a -c  -- wesnoth-debug-stubout -d < src/trusted/sniversal/launch.stdin

----------------

It kind of works.

* The sound is glitchy in sel_universal, perfect in Chrome.
* Strange video artifacts. Could be related to the incorrect handling of premultipied alpha in SDL/NaCl.
* Fontconfig needs real stat().
* Pango looks for its files in the host system. Results (together with FontConfig troubles) in garbage displayed instead of text.
* The resulting binary does not pass NaCl validator. It does after ncval_stubout!

---------------

There is a quick and dirty opendir() and stat() support compiled into Wesnoth.
It requires that indexdir.sh script is run in every directory that must be recognized as such.
