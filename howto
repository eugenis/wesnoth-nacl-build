Install nacl toolchain in $HOME/root/ (so that compilers are in $HOME/root/nacl-sdk/bin).

Build and install all naclports, don't forget the patch.
NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=$HOME/root/nacl-sdk ./nacl-install-all-bitsize.sh 64

Build and install the following packages from http://github.com/eugenis.
Most of them have a build.sh script in the repository root. "A -> B" mean B depends on A.
  bzip2 -> boost
  glib -> pango
  SDL_mixer
  SDL_image
  SDL_ttf
  SDL_net

Get wesnoth-1.9.4 from official site, apply the patch (wesnoth-1.9.4-nacl.patch), run build.sh.

Fix all remaining issues.

PROFIT!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, you also need to build and install wesnoth. Unfortunately, that's not covered by
this tutorial.

SDL_mixer has to be built with Ogg Vorbis support (runtime dependency).

There are surely more problems that I do not know of yet.
