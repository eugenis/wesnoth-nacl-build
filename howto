Install nacl toolchain in $HOME/root/ (so that compilers are in $HOME/root/nacl-sdk/bin).

Build and install all naclports, don't forget the patch.
NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=$HOME/root/nacl-sdk ./nacl-install-all-bitsize.sh 64

Build and install, in this order, the following packages from http://github.com/eugenis.
All of them have a build.sh script in the repository root.
  bzip2
  boost
  glib
  pango

...

PROFIT!

Of course, you also need to build and install wesnoth. Unfortunately, that's not covered by
this tutorial.

Boost port lacks boost-asio, which requires network headers, which are missing from the current glibc toolchain.

There are surely more problems that I do not know of yet.
